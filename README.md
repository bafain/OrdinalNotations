# Ordinal notations via simultaneous definitions
We define a notation system for the ordinals below ε₀ simultaneously with its ordering.  Our simultaneous definitions generate only the ordinal terms in Cantor normal form which are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinals below ε₀.  We implement the ordinal notation system as inductive-inductive-recursive definitions in Agda.
