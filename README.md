# Three equivalent ordinal notation systems in Cubical Agda
We present three ordinal notation systems representing ordinals below
ε₀ in type theory, using recent type-theoretical innovations such as
mutual inductive-inductive definitions and higher inductive types.  As
case studies, we show how basic ordinal arithmetic can be developed
for these systems, and how they admit a transfinite induction
principle.  We prove that all three notation systems are equivalent,
so that we can transport results between them using the univalence
principle.
